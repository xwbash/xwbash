Hello, I'm Yiğit. I've been interested in computers since I was 13-14 years old, and I've been in the industry since I was 18-19. My journey in game development began with Unity, and for over 1-1.5 years, I worked on casual projects, but currently, I'm developing playable advertisements in Unity and CocosCreator. I enjoy developing with Shader Graph, Editor Tools and Modular Systems. Additionally, I can use advanced tools like After Effects and Blender3D. I've developed various applications for Windows and Linux, which has given me knowledge in Python, C#, C++, and some TypeScript.

## 🌌 Open Source Projects

These projects were built upon a very poor system, lacking in SOLID principles and far from object-oriented programming. They were developed during my education and exhibit a writing style devoid of SOLID principles and OOP.
